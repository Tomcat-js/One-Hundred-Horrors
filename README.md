# One Hundred Horrors <hr /> 

## An interactive horror themed art installation.  [See Here](https://tomcat-js.github.io/One-Hundred-Horrors/)

### Description <hr /> 
One hundred still images from horror movies are selected from a loop making http requests to the Giphy API. When clicked on by a user a still image is replaced with a repeating gif of the same scene as if the television has been turned on. The click event also triggers an audio sample to play a haunting melody or terrifying sound effect to accompany the moving image.    

### Features and Technologies <hr /> 
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Axios
* Giphy API
* Responsive design
* Samples from freesound.org
* Sound design and audio editing in Ableton Live

### Key Challenges <hr /> 
Working with web audio was a new experience and required a small amount of research and experimentation. Making the design responsive and keeping the correct proportions of the television backgrounds while in alignment with the gifs also required some detailed editing and adjusting. Finding, creating and manipulating appropriate audio samples to blend seamlessly with one another was also a challenge but for the most part was incredibly fun.
