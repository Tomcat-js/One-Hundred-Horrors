# One Hundred Horrors <hr /> 

## An interactive horror themed art installation.  [See Here](https://tomcat-js.github.io/One-Hundred-Horrors/)

### Description <hr /> 
One hundred still images from horror movies are selected at random from a loop making http requests to the Giphy API. When clicked on by a user a still image is replaced with a repeating gif of the same scene as if it has come to life. The click event also triggers an audio sample to play a haunting melody or terrifying sound effect to accompany the moving image. To create an element of surprise, the user experience time is limited by a set timeout event which clears the screen and presents a repeating background of black TVs flickering with static before cutting to black.      

### Features and Technologies <hr /> 
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Axios
* Tone.js
* Giphy API
* Responsive design

* Sound design and audio editing in Ableton Live

### Key Challenges <hr /> 
Working with web audio was a new experience and required a small amount of research and experimentation. Utilising the objects and functions of Tone.js proved to be an effective way to locate and trigger audio samples. Making the design responsive and keeping the correct proportions of the television backgrounds while in alignment with the gifs also required some detailed editing and adjusting. Finding, creating and manipulating appropriate audio samples to blend seamlessly with one another was also a challenge but for the most part was incredibly fun.
